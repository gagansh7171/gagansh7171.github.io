If you like the portfolio, please give it a ‚≠ê and if you want to copy it, please feel free to do so. I will list down the steps for the same.
  1. Fork the repository in your GitHub account. This will make a copy of my repository and you will be able to edit it.
  2. Change content in `src/pages` according to your profile. Each page has been written in a way so that it's easy to identify modification targets.
  3. You can add or edit contents of `public/assets` as per your profile. Images for visual content, Certi for certificates and testimonials, Workex for your work places and Resume.pdf for your resume. Replace logos in `public` with yours.
  4. Replace svg in `src/components/open.js` with your svg for Chat Widget. Add your Email-JS creds in `src/components/Chat.js`.
  5. Obviously, you are not restricted to the above edits. Feel free to fiddle around with code and add or remove features and make it personalized. If you think, you can add a great feature in the application, don't hesitate to send a pull request or even opening an issue. I will be happy to review it.
